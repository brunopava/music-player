This is a simple oldschool mp3 music player with built in search and download capabilities using [spotify-downloader]([http://example.com](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader)) and Unity

In order for the app to work you need to run the API server [backend](https://github.com/brunopava/ven-back/) (python FastAPI): 

Once the API is running copy the URL on settings menu, the app now can search and download songs

Playing songs only works on Android using [ANA](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/android-native-audio-35295).



This app is a work in progress.
