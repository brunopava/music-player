This is a simple oldschool mp3 music player with built in search and download capabilities using spot-dl and unity

In order for the app to work you need to run the API server backend (python FastAPI): https://github.com/brunopava/ven-back/

Once the API is running copy the URL on settings menu, the app now can search and download songs

Playing songs only works on Android using ANA:

This app is a work in progress.
